# Graded Assignment 6: Orbit Report

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  For more documentation on working with **Create React App** see the [Create-React-App-README](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/orbitReport-React/blob/main/Create-React-App-README.md) file in this repo.

## Getting Started
1. Fork and [clone this repo from GitHub](https://plainenglish.io/blog/how-to-clone-an-app-from-github-446541a0302d)
2. Open this in Visual Studio Code
3. Use the terminal to `cd` into the project directory.
4. Use the following commands to get the start the project:
  1. `npm install` this will pull in dependencies your project may need.  
  2. `npm start` will run the project.

## Assignment Overview:
1. Create componenets to render an interactive table that displays statellites.  The satellites render based on a button click.  You will create the buttons, the table, and functions that connect them.  It's going to be great!  :)
2. When finished with your interactive table, you will run the unit tests found in `App.test.js`.  There are a total of 9 tests in that file.  When you pass all of the tests, let your TA know and review your project with them. 


## Running the Unit Tests
This project uses unit tests to help autograde the work.  
The tests should pass based on files you create and its overall behavior.
  ### To Run the Tests 
  Use these steps to start the tests:
  1. In the terminal, `cd` into the project directory.
  2. Run the following commands to start the tests: `npm tests`
  3. You should see the following when you first run the tests:

As you work through the assignment you will create and add more code.  When you reach the last section of the instuctions, you will be asked to run the unit tests.  

If you code behaves as expected you should pass all of the unit tests and see this:

### Troubleshooting
Trouble shooting tips for this project and the unit tests are found in the Graded Assignment 6 part of the textbook.

Happy coding! :)
