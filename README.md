# Graded Assignment 6: Orbit Report

This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  For more on working with **Create React App** see the [Create-React-App-README](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/orbitReport-React/blob/main/Create-React-App-README.md) file in this repo.

## Getting Started
1. Fork and [clone this repo from GitHub](https://plainenglish.io/blog/how-to-clone-an-app-from-github-446541a0302d)
2. Open this in Visual Studio Code (or your favorite IDE for React projects)
3. Use the terminal to cd into the project directory.
4. Use the following commands to start the project:
  1. `npm install` this will pull in dependencies your project may need.
  2. `npm start` will run the project.


## Assignment Overview:
1. Create components to render an interactive table that displays satellites. The satellites render based on a button click. You will create the buttons, the table, and the function that connect them. It's going to be great! :)
2. When finished with your interactive table, you will run the unit tests found in `App.test.js.` There are a total of 9 tests in that file. When you pass all the tests, let your TA know and review your project with them.


## Running the Unit Tests
This project uses unit tests to help auto-grade your work.
The tests should pass based on the files you create and their behavior.
  
### To Run the Tests 
Use these steps to start the tests:
  1. In the terminal, cd into the project directory.
  2. Run the following commands to start the tests: `npm test`

  You should see the following if you run the tests _BEFORE_ completing the assignment:

  As you work through the assignment, you will create and add more code. When you reach the last section of the instructions, you will run the unit tests.

  If your code behaves as expected, you should pass all the unit tests and see this:

### Troubleshooting
Troubleshooting tips for this project and the unit tests are in the textbook.

Happy coding! :)
